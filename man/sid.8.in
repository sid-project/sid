.SH DESCRIPTION
Storage Instantiation Daemon (SID) aims to help with Linux storage
device state tracking that encompasses device layers, groups and whole
stacks by monitoring progression of events. Based on monitored states
and further recorded information, it is able to trigger associated
actions for well-defined triggers, including activation and deactivation
of devices and their layers in the stack.

SID positions itself on top of \fBudev\fP, reacting to udev uevents.
It is closely interlinked and cooperating with udev daemon. A specialized
\fBusid\fP helper command is executed in udev rules to communicate with
SID daemon which in turn triggers further processing.

At its core, SID provides an infrastructure and an API for various
device subsystems to create modules that handle specific device types
and their abstractions. For this purpose, it organizes overall uevent
processing into discrete and controlled steps and, through an API, it
provides access to its own SID database for use within core parts as
well as modules to store and retrieve extended information besides udev
daemon’s database capabilities.

The SID database contains both internal and general-purpose records.
The internal records are accessed only through dedicated API calls which
are used to track and support device dependencies, grouping, triggers
and associated actions. The general-purpose records can be stored and
retrieved by modules directly with a possibility to define their key
components, scope of visibility and access type.

Since SID keeps track of the overall storage device stack and grouping,
it provides an insight into the stack, the device and group dependencies
and it is able to notify when there are changes to certain parts of the
device stack to which there needs to be an appropriate action executed
either inside (using SID’s triggers and associated actions) or outside
SID itself (using extended notifications that SID sends out).
